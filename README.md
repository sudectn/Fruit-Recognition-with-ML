# Fruit-Recognition-with-ML
A project where image processing (CNN) is applied to fruit photos to extract specific features and perform machine learning on them, using 8 fruits: apple, kiwi, plum, banana, watermelon, melon, strawberry, and orange.

The used codes and Excel files are located in the proje_son folder. The models saved in the mnt2 folder are available. The documents contain only apple images. The fruit-360 dataset was used as the image source. The fruits in the try_meyve folder were created from fruits outside the main dataset to be tested with the test code after the learning and testing phases. The data in the Grafik folder consist of results from the learning, testing, and trial phases.
